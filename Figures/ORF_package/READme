Hopefully this version (27 November 2023) is the most updated one I have.

[ORF_package](https://github.com/Delo95/PhD_Thesis/tree/main/Figures/ORF_package) is a collection of functions to evaluated different kind of ORFs 
(small antenna limit and beyond, iso, aniso, pixel, SpH, parity-violations, extra polarisations, generating random detectors and baselines) that I started develop as an exercise game.
The code is far from being in a good shape and minor bugs could emerge if used differently than how I have envisaged it, but it does its work properly and fast.
